OVERVIEW

Purpose of Project

Dana is looking to build a dynamic webpage for her research on UFO sightings using javascript, bootstrap and html to make it more visually appealing. She would like her webpage to have extrafunctionality to enhance use experience. She purposes to insert filters to define page, content and exhance interactiveness. These  filters deploy multiple criteria at same time and include date, city, country, state and shape.

RESULTS

For result splease click on index.html run on live server.
We modified index-html to create more table filters to incorporate filtering of city, country, state and shape. Using the forEach function, we allowed the script to loop through each row to account for filtered value and id, while deleting any unwanted data. 
The result is a table with coloumns for each criterium with associated data. 

SUMMARY

At the bottom of the literature on UFO sightings is a summary table of data which is iseful on UFO sightings per city,state, country and date.
The left hand side of the research page on the browser containes the filter search. A user can serach using Dates, cities, state and country for information.

Drawback

A major drawback is that the user is limited in the search criteria. 

Dana's research is not linked to other files. User is confined to information on that page

Recommendation

1.  Limit the elements in index-html.

2.  Improve event hanlding to reduce repeated execution.
